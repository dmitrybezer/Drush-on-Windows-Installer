
DESCRIPTION
===========

The Drush Windows Installer  provides a convenient way to install Drush and the 
components it needs in order to run on Microsoft Windows. 
Please see the installation guide below for instructions on how to compile 
the installer.

REQUIREMENTS
============

* To be able to compile you will need WiX Toolset v3.5. It can be donwloaded 
  from here: http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102
  
COMPILATION PROCEDURE
=====================

Here is described the current way the installer is being compiled.

1. Update from git and (important) update the submodule so it downloads latest
Drush sources.

2. Run heat in the SRC folder to generate drush.wxi

Example:
set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Windows Installer XML v3.5\bin
heat dir ".\Drush" -scom -sreg -srd -dr DrushFolder -gg -cg CG_DRUSH -var var.DrushSourceDir -out drush.wxi 

3. Compare Include\drush.wxi and the new drush.wxi file for newly added 
and removed files. The changes from drush.wxi should be migrated to 
Include\drush.wxi

4. Open Settings.wxi and increase the version.

You need to edit the following lines:

<?define ProductCode="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" ?>
Generate NEW Product Code in Registry GUID format.

<?define CurrentVersion="VER.DATE" ?>  
The CurrentVersion format is consisting of version and date: for example
version 1.0.12 made on date 14 Feb 2012 will have CurrentVersion=1.0.12.20214
The format of the date part is: 
[last digit of the year][month with leading zeros][day with leading zeros]

5. Build new Release and Debug versions

6. Smoke Test: test, test, test!

7. Commit all the changes

(Optional)
If you want to debug the installer you can start it this way:
msiexec /i DrushSetup.msi /l*vx DrushInstall.log
